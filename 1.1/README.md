1.What is TypeScript?
=> TypeScript is an Object Oriented Programming Language that is built on top of JavaScript with extra necessary features.


2. What is the lacking in JavaScript?
=> JavaScript is a dynamically typed language what means we can assign any types of data in a variables in JavaScript. This is a very serious issue when we try to use JavaScript in a mid to large scale. These type related issue can't in seen in before the compilation time with JavaScript. It can be seen in the runtime.That's why it's hard to find bugs, difficult to maintain large scale codebase with JavaScript.


3. Why TypeScript?
=> TypeScript has solved the problems with JavaScript.
    * TypeScript has provides us Type Safety of variables
    * Easy to find bugs because it's show any type related error immediately. So, don't have to go runtime for finding bugs.
    * It's provides us backward compatibility to any older version of JavaScript
