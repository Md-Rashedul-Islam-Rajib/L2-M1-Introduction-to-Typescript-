# TypeScript Overview

### 1. What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is an object-oriented programming language that is built on top of JavaScript, adding additional features to enhance development. It provides optional static typing, interfaces, and other advanced features that make code more maintainable and reliable.

### 2. What is Lacking in JavaScript?
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning you can assign any type of data to a variable, leading to potential issues in larger projects. Because JavaScript does not enforce types at compile-time, type-related errors only surface at runtime, which makes debugging more challenging. This can create difficulties in managing and scaling a large codebase.

### 3. Why TypeScript?
TypeScript addresses many of JavaScript's shortcomings, providing:

- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures variables have consistent types, preventing unexpected type errors.
- **Early Bug Detection**: Type-related errors are caught at compile-time, so you can identify issues before runtime, making debugging easier.
- **Backward Compatibility**: TypeScript is compatible with all JavaScript versions, meaning you can use TypeScript features on top of existing JavaScript code.
- **Advanced Types for Productivity**: TypeScript provides additional types such as `interface`, `type`, `enum`, `tuple`, and `void`, enhancing productivity and code structure.

TypeScript combines JavaScriptâ€™s flexibility with the reliability of a statically typed language, making it ideal for larger, more complex projects.
